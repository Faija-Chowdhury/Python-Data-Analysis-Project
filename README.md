# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
A supermarket data analysis project using python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and jupyter notebooks in Anaconda.
I started by exploring the dataset checking its shape, data types, and column names. Then, I moved on to clean the data by handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies to prepare it for analysis.

# Project Highlights
In this project, I addressed some self-defined analytical requirements using a dataset. The key metrics I calculated include:

Total Sales – The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

Average Sales – The average revenue per sale, offering insights into typical transaction value.

Number of Items – The total count of distinct items sold.

Average Rating – The average customer rating for the sold items, reflecting overall customer satisfaction.

# Data Visualization Overview

I worked with several charts in this projects to better understand the data and extract insights.
Here is one of the visualizations i created:
# Sales by Fat content

This pie chart illustrates the proportion of sales between Low Fat and Regular content products:
 ## Low Fat products make up 64.6% of total sales
 ## Regular products account for 35.4%

 This suggests that Low Fat items are significantly more popular.
