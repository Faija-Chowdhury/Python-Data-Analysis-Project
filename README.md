# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
A supermarket data analysis project using python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and jupyter notebooks in Anaconda.
I started by exploring the dataset checking its shape, data types, and column names. Then, I moved on to clean the data by handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies to prepare it for analysis.

# Project Highlights
In this project, I addressed some self-defined analytical requirements using a dataset. The key metrics I calculated include:

1. Total Sales – The overall revenue generated from all items sold.

2. Average Sales – The average revenue per sale, offering insights into typical transaction value.

3. Number of Items – The total count of distinct items sold.

4. Average Rating – The average customer rating for the sold items, reflecting overall customer satisfaction.

# Data Visualization Overview

I worked with several charts in this projects to better understand the data and extract insights.
Here are charts the visualizations i created:
# Sales by Fat content

This pie chart illustrates the proportion of sales between Low Fat and Regular content products:
 ## Low Fat products make up 64.6% of total sales
 ## Regular products account for 35.4%

 This suggests that Low Fat items are significantly more popular.
 
 
 # Total Sales by Item Type
This bar chart visualizes the total sales revenue generated for each item category. It provides a clear comparison of performance across different product types.

# Why I used this chart:
I chose a bar chart because it's ideal for comparing categorical data like item types. It allows us to easily identify which product categories contribute most to overall sales.

# What the chart shows:
1. Fruits and Vegetables and Snack Foods are the top-selling categories, generating over 170,000 in revenue each.

2. Categories like Seafood, Breakfast, and Starchy Foods have the lowest total sales.

3. This visual helps stakeholders and decision-makers quickly spot which product types are the most and least profitable.

4. This chart played a key role in understanding which items drive revenue and where the business may need to focus improvement or promotional efforts.
